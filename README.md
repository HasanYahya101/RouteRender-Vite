# RouteRender (React + Vite)

## Introduction

This is a basic Dijkstra's path finding algorithm visualizer. You set a start and an end tile. The algorithm starts searching each tile it can and finally finds and displays the shortest path.

## UI Library

Radix UI and ShadCN components were used to create the UI of the website. Moreover, Vite was used to create this React Project.

## Deployment

This project was deployed to Github Pages and can be tested there. No servers or databases were used in this Project.

## Preview

## React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
